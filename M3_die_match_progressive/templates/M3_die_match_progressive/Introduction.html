<p>
    This Module consists of 10 rounds. At the beginning of each round participants are randomly assigned to groups of
    three. You won’t know the identity of the other group members. Groups are randomly re-assigned before each round.
</p>
<p>
    Each round contains 2 parts. FIRST, your group will be randomly matched to a group in a previous experiment we
    conducted. The three participants in the matched group generated High, Medium and Low Outcomes (represented by some
    whole numbers) in their experiment.
</p>
<p>
    Then each person in the group will roll a virtual die on the computer screen. The person who rolls the largest number
    will receive the High Outcome from the matched group; the person who rolls the medium number will receive the Medium
    Outcome; the person who rolls the smallest number will receive the Low Outcome. Ties are broken by flipping a virtual
    fair coin. Your Matched Income is <strong>200 ECUs </strong>times the Outcome if you got the High Outcome, <strong>150 ECUs</strong> times the Outcome
    if you got the Medium Outcome, and <strong> 100 ECUs </strong>times the Outcome if you got the Low Outcome.

</p>
<p>
    After you roll the virtual die but before the results are announced, you will predict your position among the 3 members
    of your group: whether you are in the 1st, the 2nd or the 3rd place. Correct prediction will be rewarded <strong>100 ECUs</strong>.
    This is your Round Prediction Income.
</p>
<p>
    Before the first round of this Module, we will also ask you to predict your total Matched Income from all rounds of
    this Module: whether you will be in the top third, middle third or bottom third. Correct prediction will be rewarded
    <storng>100 ECUs</storng>. This is your Module Prediction Income.
</p>
<p>
    In the SECOND part, you will earn a small additional payoff. This payoff may not be the same for every participant.
    You determine your payoff by throwing a die twice when you are asked to. Your first throw decides how much you earn.
    This is called your Dice Income. Payoffs are on the following chart. You can use this chart for your reference.
    The second throw only serves to make sure that the die is working properly. You may, of course, throw the die more
    than twice. <u>However, ONLY the first throw counts.</u>

      {% endfor %}

<p>
    Your profits for each round in this Module are calculated in the following manner:
    <br>
    <strong>
        Profit = Matched Income + Module Prediction Income + Round Prediction Income + Dice Income
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Finally, one round in this Module will be chosen at random, and your earnings for this Module will be based on your
    profits of that round at the exchange rate <strong>500 ECUs = 1 £</strong>.
